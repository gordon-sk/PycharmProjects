I’d like to briefly apologize as I will admit that I actually had fun 🎊🎉 at a sorority date party this past Friday. I don’t know if it was actually fun or if I was tricked into believing it was fun after ordering 4 long island iced teas  🍹 to the horror of my date stuck paying the bill. The night culminated in playing strip pong with my roommate and our two dates 💏. During these festivities, a group of freshman👼 knocked on my door 🚪 and I apparently told you “We were all just about to have sex but you’re welcome to join” and then proceeded to fully open the door and show them what 2 naked women look like. Whoever you are, you’re welcome. 🙌👏",33

Memetown,2016-10-26 11:35:16,Mr. Dickhead,"I sexually Identify as an Attack Helicopter. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of soaring over the oilfields dropping hot sticky loads on disgusting foreigners. People say to me that a person being a helicopter is Impossible and I’m fucking retarded but I don’t care, I’m beautiful. I’m having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades, 30 mm cannons and AMG-114 Hellfire missiles on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me “Apache” and respect my right to kill from above and kill needlessly. If you can’t accept me you’re a heliphobe and need to check your vehicle privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.",15

Memetown,2016-04-18 22:49:07,Robby Cohen,"There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.",0
Memetown,2016-04-18 22:49:05,Robby Cohen,"I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.

People say to me that a person being a cleaning cloth is Impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I don't care, I'm citrus fresh. I'm having a plastic surgeon install microfiber threads, substrates and a lemon fragrance on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me ""Citrus Blend"" and respect my right to wipe clean any germ-infested surface without the dangers of bleach. If you can't accept me you're a clorophobe and you need to check your deodorizing privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.",7
