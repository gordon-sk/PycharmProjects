The vector between Jonson and Shakespeare vs Bacon and Shakespeare has a significantly different
magnitude, (thankfully) implying that the three are not the same -- what a mess that would
be. Other than that it is hard to draw definitive conclusions from the data post-processing.
We can definitely say that Bacon is less likely than Jonson to be the author, but we also
know Jonson is less likely to be the purported ghostwriter behind Shakespeare, as the project
file states his life was best-documented at the time and he is thus least accused of having
used Shakespeare's name for his writing.

So did either do it? Reading through their respective Wikipedia articles, especially
Shakespeare's it is evident that the documentation from the period is in general pretty poor.
It feels that more is unknown than known when it comes to how these men lived. I think that
makes it difficult in general to accuse someone of having their name stolen or used --
and analyzing their word counts, as well as just reading their respective works
and noting the stylistic differences, seems to further weaken the case.

I received no assistance from any person.

4.
I used the good old fashioned Google to access specific questions about syntax and various errors.
Most results were questions asked by other students on Stack Overflow.

Probably 3 or 4. I'm a slow worker.

This assignment was honestly pretty easy, especially with a sample of what the output should look like.
I definitely enjoyed it though. It's nice to use code to do something applicable like this in a big-data
setting.

Description was excellent.
